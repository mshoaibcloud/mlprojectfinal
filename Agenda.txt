    a) create a new environment
    b) setup.py
    c) requirements.txt

Repository: mshoaibCloud/mlprojectfinal
after create it show the something.

>code .
and goto Terminal and create the new environment

mlprojectfinal>python -m venv venv

# activate
.\venv\Scripts\activate

#if you want to create a new project with its own env
>python -m venv D:\MLPROJECTS\mlproject2\venv

'.\.venv\Scripts\activate'

deactivate


# how we connect with github

# first of all,
we activate the venv for this project,
and   

venv>git init
Initialized empty Git repository in D:/MLPROJECTS/mlprojectfinal/.git/
# now create an new file README.md
>git add README.md 
#noted that its color is green mean it is waiting to commit with git.
>git commit -m "first commit"
done: and change color grey mean ok.
[master (root-commit) 8999f65] first commit for add Readme.md file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md

#so i want to see 
>git status

On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what
will be committed)

        Agenda.txt
        venv/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

#noted that it is untracked not going to github, when i push it.
so how we track it.

Now we check first the main branch:
>git branch -M main
and see it
>git remote -v
#noted that its nothing to do push and pull
>git remote add origin https://github.com/mshoaibcloud/mlprojectfinal.git

>git remote add origin https://github.com/mshoaibcloud/mlproject.git
>git remote -v
# now it show the origin path to push and pull.
origin  https://github.com/mshoaibcloud/mlprojectfinal.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/mshoaibcloud/mlprojectfinal.git (push)

it's Okay: now we push the file into it.
now check the global config:
git global config:
git config --global user.name 'mshoaibcloud'
git config --global user.email ''  # this will show you the email.
git config --global user.email ""  # if you want to change the email.


>git push -u origin main
now reloaded it


Now we create a new file .gitignore [Python] and change commit
similarly you create other file and pull it.
>git pull

Now we create 2 -files
setup.py and 
Writing script for setup.py
beacuse it is responsible for 
building a ml application as a package.
and you can also install this package in your project.
and even deploy in PiPi.

see the setup.py code:
from setuptools import find_packages,setup

setup()


requirements.txt
There are many packages by search python pypi,
[seaborn]

After >pip install -r requirements.txt

it build the mlprojectfinal.egg-info folder 
the structure of the project.

Now if we add them to github,

>git add .
>git status
>git commit -m "setup the project"







Before going to push 
> git add .
> git commit -m "setup"

>git push -u origin main
now reloaded it


#check pull:
When you enter into the git repository: create a new file .gitignore and choose the python language.

Now we change the commit: Create the .gitignore file. and click on the commit changes

So we have 2-files : 1.README.md and 2. .gitignore

Now > git pull

Next we create a setup.py and requirements.txt file

search python setup.py and see the writing script:
write script in setup.py,

and then run> pip install -r requirements.txt



git remote add origin https://github.com/mshoaibcloud/mlproject.git
git branch -M main

#After complete the process
> git add .
> git status

> git commit -m "setup"

>git push -u origin main
